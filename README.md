# DjowdaGeminiMap

**DjowdaGeminiMap** is an experimental Android project that connects the Djowda ecosystem’s **MinMax99 map system** with Google’s **Gemini API**.  
The goal is to test **natural language navigation and interaction** with Djowda components (stores, farmers, factories, etc.) directly on the map.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
Djowda is building a decentralized food-tech ecosystem.  
This repo explores how **AI navigation** can help users interact with the map:
- 🗺️ **Find nearby components** (e.g., stores, farmers).  
- 📍 **Navigate to the closest cell**.  
- 🤖 **Ask in natural language** and get structured map actions back.  

---

## ⚙️ Features (Testing Scope)
- Integration with **Gemini API**.  
- Function-calling style responses → JSON map actions.  
- Android UI that highlights Djowda components on the grid.  
- Example queries:
  - “Show me all stores in my area.”  
  - “Navigate me to the nearest farmer.”  
  - “What Djowda components are in this 10x10 block?”
